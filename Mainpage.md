NF6A Project "Le Marcel Manager"


“Among all its mobility services, Troyes Champagne Métropole offers Le Marcel, a self-service electric bicycle rental service, available 7 days a week, 24 hours a day.”
The city of Troyes introduced a new electrical bikes rental service called “Le marcel“, with docking stations all over the city. People can rent a bike and return it to any of these stations.
Allowing such flexibility comes at a cost, the city needs to manage these stations and bikes to ensure a good user experience. This includes: bike maintenance, station maintenance, stations load balancing... The city is asking you to build a management system to help them improve their service

The goal is to use python and C to build a management system for the Le Marcel project.
